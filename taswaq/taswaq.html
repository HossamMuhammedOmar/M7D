              We created this application with a unique approach since it does
              not focus on buying and selling but rather on comparing costs. We
              believed it would be a unique and distinctive application, so we
              performed some surveys, which were good and encouraged us to take
              the first steps. My role in developing this app was as a Logo &
              UI/UX designer. So, are you interested in learning more about the
              app? Let me take you on a little tour of the design process.

              <span>2.</span> To make page navigation as simple as possible.<br />

              <span>4.</span> To avoid using ambiguous buttons that may lead the
              user to click it just to guess where it will take him/ her. <br />
              <span>5.</span> Finally, make the app as accessible as possible to

          <h2>What is special about the app?!</h2>
          <p>
            Taswaq application is distinct from the other well-known
            applications, which are applications for purchasing and selling
            various things. Taswaq application offers various items from various
            stores so that a user may compare prices between stores. Let me
            illustrate by using an example. Let's guess someone named Ahmed
            wants to buy an iPhone and wants to know where he can get it for the
            best price. All he has to do is open the Taswaq app and search for
            the phone he wants. Then, he'll get a list of that phone with
            varying prices at various stores such as Amazon, Noon, and others.
            Finally, Ahmed will be sent to the desired store through the app. So
            our objective was to give a helpful, straightforward, and easy way
            for users to compare costs and purchase the best and most suited for
            them.

        <h2>Starting the Journey</h2>
        <p>
          First, let me share some information regarding the app's user flow.
          The first steps in the design process should include a diagram that
          explains the important points that the user will go through when using
          the app, as well as how the user will interact with the app. We should
          keep the user in mind as UX designers; the user should be front and
          center. So, when considering how the user journey would be with the
          app, diagramming the user flow is a great place to start. So, let's
          see a quick diagram!

        <h2>Paper wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          Paper wireframes are an essential part of the design process. After I
          have completed the general form (Diagramming) of how to go around the
          application so that the user can finish the process effectively and
          without any barriers, I begin developing the wireframes on paper. I
          must decide how the app will work. I want it to be basic,
          straightforward, and free of distractions that might lead the user
          astray. Of course, adjustments to the wireframes may be made later
          because the design is an iterative process, and changes may be
          required to improve or add any feature that would contribute to
          producing a positive user experience. Let's take a look at the
          application's paper wireframes.

          Feedback is critical in these modifications since it enables us to
          learn more about the needs of our users and how to improve their
          experience with our product. Great, we're nearing the end of the app's

          To decide on the final design for the app pages, UI/UX designers may
