              I created this app to assist people of all ages in finding a
              suitable dentist and scheduling an appointment from anywhere, and
              if they need assistance, chat service is available 24/7 to assist
              them. I want to know if the user has a pleasant experience
              chatting and arranging dentist appointments through the app, as
              well as any issues they may have.

        <h2>What is special about the app?!</h2>
        <p>
          Initially, I hoped to design an application that would have a good
          impact on people's lives. I intended to make an application for
          booking dentists that is simple and straightforward to use so that
          anyone could use it without difficulty. Waiting at clinics was
          becoming a problem for many individuals, including the elderly, who
          cannot handle sitting in clinics for lengthy periods of time waiting
          for their turn, as well as those who are working or busy, as well as
          others who are weary of waiting. As a result, having an app that makes
          it simpler for consumers to book the proper dentist for them, whether
          in terms of pricing or location, is something I think is fantastic.
          Furthermore, the app offers a customer support (chat) that is
          accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist anyone who is
          unable to schedule a dentist or wishes to learn more about the app.
          However, I did not stop at my viewpoint because this application is
          for the user, not for me, so I had to conduct some interviews with
          people of various ages and professions to determine whether or not
          this application would be beneficial in their life. So, do you want to
          learn more about some of the users? Let's go together and meet them.
