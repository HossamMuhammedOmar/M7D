          <h2>What is special about the app?!</h2>
          <p>
            Initially, I hoped to design an application that would have a good
            impact on people's lives. I intended to make an application for
            booking dentists that is simple and straightforward to use so that
            anyone could use it without difficulty. Waiting at clinics was
            becoming a problem for many individuals, including the elderly, who
            cannot handle sitting in clinics for lengthy periods of time waiting
            for their turn, as well as those who are working or busy, as well as
            others who are weary of waiting. As a result, having an app that
            makes it simpler for consumers to book the proper dentist for them,
            whether in terms of pricing or location, is something I think is
            fantastic. Furthermore, the app offers a customer support (chat)
            that is accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist anyone
            who is unable to schedule a dentist or wishes to learn more about
            the app. However, I did not stop at my viewpoint because this
            application is for the user, not for me, so I had to conduct some
            interviews with people of various ages and professions to determine
            whether or not this application would be beneficial in their life.
            So, do you want to learn more about some of the users? Let's go
            together and meet them.

        <div class="competitive-txt">
          <p>
            At the start of creating an application, I must look at competitors
            to learn more about comparable apps and how I can benefit from their
            features while also providing more valuable features for the user so
            that I can provide an unique user experience. Although I could not
            uncover any applications or websites that are exactly like what I
            want to build, there are several that may be studied and used to
            benefit from some of their amazing qualities. <br />
            I attempted to make the Smile app easier to use and navigate through
            its pages. Furthermore, I worked to keep the design basic and the
            page lack of elements that may distract the user and make him/ her
            impossible to distinguish between the stages required to book a
            dentist appointment.

        <h2>Starting the Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I began by drawing and deciding on the user flow by diagramming to
          understand how the user will interact with the app and how I would
          build the app in a simple manner. The most crucial aspect of UX design
          is to keep the user in mind; the user should be front and center. So,
          diagramming the user flow is a good place to start when thinking how
          the user will interact with the app. So, let's have a look at the
          diagram together!

        <h2>Paper wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          Paper wire frames are an essential part of the design process. After I
          have completed the general form (Diagramming) of how to go around the
          application so that the user can finish the process effectively and
          without any barriers, I begin developing the wireframes on paper. I
          must decide how the app will work. I want it to be basic,
          straightforward, and free of distractions that might lead the user
          astray. Of course, I may make changes to the wireframes later if I
          find or think of something new. Actually, I adjusted some things in
          the following stages and added more screens and features.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most essential thing is to put the user front and center. So,
          let's have a look at the paper wireframes for the application, which
          is a step closer to completion. In these frames, I attempted to
          simplify the user's path so that everyone can quickly navigate between
          its pages and complete the process.

          After modifying some of the wireframes on paper, I began creating the
          wireframes using Figma. I adjusted a few details since the design on
          paper may differ from the design on computer programmes.

          Then comes the low-fidelity prototype. A low-fidelity prototype is
          just as vital as any other stage of the design process. It
          demonstrates how the app will work when the user uses it. What does
          this button accomplish, and what page should show when the user clicks
          it? As seen, I do not focus on colors or visuals at this stage (Lo-fi
          wireframes & prototype) but rather on navigation between pages and how
          to make the app as easy, accessible, usable, and beneficial as
          possible for every user. Following the lo-fi prototype, I may invite
          some users to check out the app and complete various tasks to
          determine how user-friendly the app is. Let's continue on our journey!

        <p>
          After I finish the low-fidelity prototype, I should test it in real
          life before moving to high-fidelity wireframes and prototype. So, I do
          a brief study (Moderated research) on a few individuals, assigning
          them tasks and seeing how they engage with the app. I discovered that
          there are several things that should be altered after putting down how
          they feel and what they found difficult:
        </p>
        <div class="orders-list">

            Customer service; some people have difficulty contacting customer
            service. Some believe that it should be in the settings and so, they
            are on the wrong path.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people were unable to cancel or reschedule a planned
            appointment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Location. More options are needed to make it simple for anybody to
            change the location.

        <h2>Iteration & Hi-fi design</h2>
        <p>
          After getting some user feedback on the app, I was able to figure out
          what was bothering them while using it, and I was able to remedy those
          issues before moving on to the next step of the process. This stage is
          critical before I begin the high-fidelity prototype so that I can
          launch an app that is simple to use and meets the needs of the users.
          Because design is an iterative process, I may make changes to the
          design even after it has been launched. For now, let's look at some
          low-fidelity pages and how they appear after iteration and switch to
          high-fidelity design.

          I attempted to address some of the issues raised by the user on the

          Then, instead of settings, I convert it to a hamburger menu because
          some people aren't sure what should be in these settings and end up
          clicking it more than once to complete their process. Finally, I
          reduced the number of nearby dentists on the page and made it scroll
          down to make the screen more basic and distraction-free.

          The biggest issue with this page is that the booking button is not
          obvious, and some users return to see whether they missed any steps.
          As some users suggest, adjusting the booking button and centering it
          is preferable. Of course, I changed it because I sought to provide a
          pleasant user experience.

          I also have some troubles here. First, there is a confirmation button,
          which has the same issue as the booking button. As a result, I modify
          it as well and center it. Then, I deleted the information about the
          dentist since I noticed that I was repeating the same information on
          two pages. This makes the appointment page more straightforward and
          allows the user to focus just on selecting an appointment without
          being distracted by anything else. Finally, in order for the design to
          be consistent, the page should have the same or a similar style.
