          <h2>What is special about the app?!</h2>
          <p>
            Initially, I hoped to design an application that would have a good
            impact on people's lives. I intended to make an application for
            booking dentists that is simple and straightforward to use so that
            anyone could use it without difficulty. Waiting at clinics was
            becoming a problem for many individuals, including the elderly, who
            cannot handle sitting in clinics for lengthy periods of time waiting
            for their turn, as well as those who are working or busy, as well as
            others who are weary of waiting. As a result, having an app that
            makes it simpler for consumers to book the proper dentist for them,
            whether in terms of pricing or location, is something I think is
            fantastic. Furthermore, the app offers a customer support (chat)
            that is accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist anyone
            who is unable to schedule a dentist or wishes to learn more about
            the app. However, I did not stop at my viewpoint because this
            application is for the user, not for me, so I had to conduct some
            interviews with people of various ages and professions to determine
            whether or not this application would be beneficial in their life.
            So, do you want to learn more about some of the users? Let's go
            together and meet them.

                    exhausted. When they go to a dental clinic or hospital, most
                    of the time, they have to wait for a while until it's their

          <p>
            At the start of creating an application, I must look at competitors
            to learn more about comparable apps and how I can benefit from their
            features while also providing more valuable features for the user so
            that I can provide an unique user experience. Although I could not
            uncover any applications or websites that are exactly like what I
            want to build, there are several that may be studied and used to
            benefit from some of their amazing qualities. <br />
            I attempted to make the Smile app easier to use and navigate through
            its pages. Furthermore, I worked to keep the design basic and the
            page lack of elements that may distract the user and make him/ her
            impossible to distinguish between the stages required to book a
            dentist appointment.

        <h2>Starting the Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I began by drawing and deciding on the user flow by diagramming to
          understand how the user will interact with the app and how I would
          build the app in a simple manner. The most crucial aspect of UX design
          is to keep the user in mind; the user should be front and center. So,
          diagramming the user flow is a good place to start when thinking how
          the user will interact with the app. So, let's have a look at the
          diagram together!
